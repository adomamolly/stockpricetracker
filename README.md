# 📈 **Stock Price Tracker & Strategy Backtester**

Python-based stock price analysis and backtesting of a moving average crossover strategy


**Overview**

This project implements and evaluates a simple moving average (SMA) crossover trading strategy using historical stock price data. The goal is to explore systematic trading strategies, backtesting methodologies, and performance analysis through code-driven experimentation.
